/** Provides an abstraction to run many interactive tasks concurrently so that
 * if one stops before others it can be replaced by a new task.
 * It also enables tasks to be replaced at any time by the server. <p>
 * This is achieved by the server being informed of which tasks are still alive
 * when it calls the get method and by the server sending out the same or new
 * tasks through the set method. If the same task as the current one is sent
 * then it is ignored. WARNING: Task equality is based on the toString() method.<p>
 * If a task is sent that the client has previously
 * completed there is an option to ignore this task, but the current implementation
 * will run this task anyway since in many cases this is not a useless
 * functionality.  To reenable this option see line marked with **!!. <p>
 * This assumes InteractiveTask implementations will be well behaved
 * and check their currentThread.isInterrupted() method.
